## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21W.747 Rhetoric_ as it was taught by Professor Steven Strang in Spring 2015.

This course is an examination of the theory, the practice, and the implications of rhetoric and rhetorical criticism. Students study the forms and structures of argumentation, including the organization of ideas, awareness of audience, methods of persuasion, evidence, factual vs. emotional argument, figures of speech, and historical forms and uses of arguments.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Think rhetorically (discover all possible means of persuasion, see persuasive possibilities, and evaluate those possibilities)
- Write rhetorically (accommodate audiences, clarify your purposes & strategies for yourself and for your audience, be as persuasive as possible with the evidence you have, and use your rhetorical skills ethically so as not to persuade others with questionable tactics)

## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "One of the ‘big insights’ of rhetoric has always been to know your audience and tailor your message to them. I have found that concrete examples are the best way to make theoretical and abstract ideas more real and understandable for just about any audience, and certainly for students. If I can make the example humorous, as well, then that’s all to the good since humor tends to be more memorable for many of us." "— Steven Strang" >}}
